Every major tech company is shipping AI agents in 2026. But behind the marketing buzzwords, what actually makes an AI agent work? And more importantly — what architecture patterns separate the demos from production systems?

This guide breaks down the four dominant agent architecture patterns, with code examples you can adapt to your own projects.

## What Is an AI Agent, Really?

An AI agent is software that uses a language model to **decide** what actions to take, **execute** those actions using tools, and **iterate** based on the results. Unlike a simple chatbot that responds to prompts, an agent has a loop:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              THE AGENT LOOP                 │
│                                             │
│   Observe ──► Think ──► Act ──► Observe     │
│      ▲                            │         │
│      └────────────────────────────┘         │
│                                             │
│   The agent keeps looping until the task    │
│   is complete or a stop condition is met.   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The key distinction: **a chatbot responds once; an agent loops until the job is done.**

Three properties define a true agent:

1. **Autonomy** — it decides which tools to use and in what order
2. **Tool use** — it can call APIs, run code, read files, query databases
3. **Memory** — it maintains context across its action loop

## Pattern 1: The ReAct Loop

The simplest and most widely-used pattern is **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting). The model alternates between reasoning about what to do and taking an action.

```python
class ReActAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = {t.name: t for t in tools}
        self.max_steps = 10

    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": task}]

        for step in range(self.max_steps):
            # THINK: Ask the LLM what to do
            response = self.llm.chat(messages, tools=self.tools)

            if response.is_final_answer:
                return response.content

            # ACT: Execute the chosen tool
            tool_name = response.tool_call.name
            tool_args = response.tool_call.arguments
            result = self.tools[tool_name].execute(**tool_args)

            # OBSERVE: Feed result back
            messages.append({"role": "tool", "content": result})

        return "Max steps reached without resolution."
```

### When to Use ReAct

- Single-purpose tasks: "Find the bug in this function"
- Linear workflows where each step informs the next
- Prototyping — it's the fastest pattern to implement

### Limitations

ReAct struggles with tasks that require **parallel work** or **planning ahead**. It's purely reactive — the model only thinks one step at a time.

## Pattern 2: Plan-and-Execute

This pattern separates **planning** from **execution**. A planner model creates a full plan upfront, then an executor works through each step.

```python
class PlanAndExecuteAgent:
    def __init__(self, planner_llm, executor_llm, tools):
        self.planner = planner_llm
        self.executor = executor_llm
        self.tools = tools

    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Phase 1: Create the plan
        plan = self.planner.chat([
            {"role": "system", "content": "Create a step-by-step plan."},
            {"role": "user", "content": task}
        ])

        steps = parse_plan(plan.content)
        results = []

        # Phase 2: Execute each step
        for step in steps:
            result = self.executor.chat([
                {"role": "system", "content": f"Execute: {step}"},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Prior results: {results}"}
            ], tools=self.tools)
            results.append(result)

        # Phase 3: Synthesize
        return self.planner.summarize(task, results)
```

```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ PLANNER  │────►│ EXECUTOR │────►│ EXECUTOR │──► ...
│          │     │ Step 1   │     │ Step 2   │
│ Creates  │     │          │     │          │
│ full plan│     │ Uses     │     │ Uses     │
│ upfront  │     │ tools    │     │ results  │
└──────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘
                                       │
                                       ▼
                                 ┌──────────┐
                                 │SYNTHESIZE│
                                 │ Final    │
                                 │ answer   │
                                 └──────────┘
```

### When to Use Plan-and-Execute

- Complex multi-step tasks: "Refactor this module and update all tests"
- When you need **predictability** — the user can review the plan before execution
- Tasks where total cost matters (the plan constrains token usage)

## Pattern 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration

For complex systems, a single agent isn't enough. Multi-agent orchestration uses **specialized agents** coordinated by a **router** or **orchestrator**.

```python
class MultiAgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, agents: dict, router_llm):
        self.agents = agents  # {"coder": CoderAgent, "reviewer": ReviewAgent, ...}
        self.router = router_llm

    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Router decides which agent handles the task
        routing = self.router.chat([
            {"role": "system", "content": self.routing_prompt()},
            {"role": "user", "content": task}
        ])

        agent_name = routing.selected_agent
        agent = self.agents[agent_name]

        # Delegate to the specialist
        result = agent.run(task)

        # Optionally pass to another agent for review
        if routing.needs_review:
            review = self.agents["reviewer"].run(
                f"Review this output:\n{result}"
            )
            return f"{result}\n\nReview: {review}"

        return result
```

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
       Task ───────►│   ROUTER     │
                    │              │
                    │ Analyzes the │
                    │ task and     │
                    │ delegates    │
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐
              ▼            ▼            ▼
        ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
        │  CODER   │ │RESEARCHER│ │ REVIEWER │
        │  Agent   │ │  Agent   │ │  Agent   │
        │          │ │          │ │          │
        │ Writes & │ │ Searches │ │ Checks   │
        │ edits    │ │ docs &   │ │ quality  │
        │ code     │ │ data     │ │ & style  │
        └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
```

### Real-World Example: Code Review Pipeline

A production code review system might use three agents:

1. **Security Agent** — scans for vulnerabilities, credential leaks, injection risks
2. **Logic Agent** — checks for bugs, race conditions, edge cases
3. **Style Agent** — enforces conventions, naming patterns, documentation

Each agent has different system prompts, different tools, and different evaluation criteria. The orchestrator merges their feedback into a single review.

## Pattern 4: Reflexion (Self-Correcting Agents)

The most advanced pattern adds **self-evaluation**. After producing output, the agent critiques its own work and iterates.

```python
class ReflexionAgent:
    def __init__(self, actor_llm, critic_llm, tools):
        self.actor = actor_llm
        self.critic = critic_llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.max_reflections = 3

    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        attempt = self.actor.chat(
            [{"role": "user", "content": task}],
            tools=self.tools
        )

        for i in range(self.max_reflections):
            # Self-evaluate
            critique = self.critic.chat([{
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Task: {task}\nAttempt:\n{attempt}\n\n"
                           f"Is this correct and complete? "
                           f"If not, what needs to change?"
            }])

            if critique.is_satisfactory:
                return attempt.content

            # Retry with feedback
            attempt = self.actor.chat([
                {"role": "user", "content": task},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": attempt.content},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Feedback: {critique.content}"}
            ], tools=self.tools)

        return attempt.content
```

### When to Use Reflexion

- High-stakes outputs: code generation, data analysis, report writing
- When you can define clear **evaluation criteria**
- When the cost of iteration is lower than the cost of errors

## Choosing the Right Pattern

| Pattern | Complexity | Best For | Watch Out |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| ReAct | Low | Single tasks, prototypes | Gets stuck on complex multi-step work |
| Plan-and-Execute | Medium | Predictable workflows | Plans can become stale mid-execution |
| Multi-Agent | High | Complex systems, specialized domains | Coordination overhead, debugging difficulty |
| Reflexion | Medium-High | Quality-critical outputs | Token cost multiplies with iterations |

## Production Considerations

### 1. Guard Rails Are Non-Negotiable

Every production agent needs:
- **Token budgets** — cap the maximum loop iterations and total tokens
- **Tool allowlists** — restrict which tools the agent can call
- **Output validation** — schema validation on structured outputs
- **Human-in-the-loop** — escalation paths for uncertain decisions

### 2. Observability

You cannot debug agents with `console.log`. You need:
- **Trace IDs** across every LLM call and tool invocation
- **Step-by-step logging** of the agent's reasoning
- **Cost tracking** per task (tokens consumed, API calls made)
- **Latency breakdowns** showing where time is spent

### 3. Evaluation

Before deploying, build an eval suite:

```python
eval_cases = [
    {"input": "Find all Python files with SQL injection risks",
     "expected_tools": ["grep", "file_read"],
     "expected_output_contains": ["parameterized", "sanitize"]},
]

for case in eval_cases:
    result = agent.run(case["input"])
    assert all(t in result.tools_used for t in case["expected_tools"])
    assert all(k in result.output for k in case["expected_output_contains"])
```

## What's Next

The agent landscape is moving fast. Key trends to watch:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — standardizing how agents connect to tools
- **Agent-to-agent communication** — agents delegating to other agents across organizational boundaries
- **Persistent memory** — agents that learn from past interactions and improve over time
- **Formal verification** — mathematical guarantees about agent behavior

The pattern you choose matters less than the guardrails you put around it. Start with ReAct, graduate to multi-agent when your use case demands it, and always instrument everything.
