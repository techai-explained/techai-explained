Docker Desktop now costs money for enterprise use. Red Hat is pushing Podman as the drop-in replacement. But is it actually a drop-in replacement? Or are there real differences that will break your workflow?

Let's find out.

## Architecture: The Daemon Difference

This is the fundamental difference — and it changes everything else.

Docker uses a client-server model with a **daemon** (dockerd) running as root. Podman is **daemonless** — each container is a direct child process of the command that started it.

```
DOCKER ARCHITECTURE          PODMAN ARCHITECTURE

docker CLI ──► dockerd       podman CLI ──► container
                │                            (direct)
                ├─► container
                ├─► container              podman CLI ──► container
                └─► container                            (direct)

Daemon = single point        No daemon = no single
of failure, runs as root     point of failure
```

When Docker's daemon crashes, all your containers go down. With Podman, there's nothing to crash — each container is its own process tree.

**The systemd advantage:** Because Podman containers are regular processes, you can manage them with systemd directly.

```bash
podman generate systemd --name myapp > /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
```

No Docker daemon needed for auto-restart on boot.

## Security: Rootless by Default

This is where Podman genuinely wins.

Docker daemon runs as root by default. Podman runs rootless by default — containers run as your user. User namespace mapping means root inside the container is NOT root on the host.

```
DOCKER (default)                PODMAN (default)

Host root ── dockerd            Host user ── podman
              │                               │
              └── container                   └── container
                  (root inside                    (root inside =
                   = root on host)                 user on host)

/var/run/docker.sock            No socket
(if compromised, full
 host access)
```

The Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is the most common container escape vector. If an attacker gets access to it, they effectively have root on your host. Podman doesn't have a socket. There's nothing to exploit.

**Demonstration:**
- `docker run -it ubuntu whoami` → root (and that maps to root on the host)
- `podman run -it ubuntu whoami` → root inside, but mapped to your user outside

Run `ps aux` on the host — Docker containers are owned by root, Podman containers are owned by your user.

## Kubernetes Compatibility

This is where Podman pulls significantly ahead for cloud-native workflows.

**Podman has native pod support** — groups of containers sharing a network namespace, exactly like Kubernetes pods.

```bash
# Create a pod
podman pod create --name myapp -p 8080:80

# Add containers to the pod
podman run -d --pod myapp nginx
podman run -d --pod myapp redis

# Export to real Kubernetes YAML
podman generate kube myapp > deployment.yaml
```

That `deployment.yaml` is valid Kubernetes. Your local Podman setup translates directly to your production cluster.

Docker has no concept of pods. You use Docker Compose for multi-container apps, but Compose YAML is not Kubernetes YAML. There's always a translation layer that breaks things.

## Docker Compose Support

About 95% of Docker Compose files work with Podman unchanged:

```
Feature                Docker Compose    Podman Compose
Build images           ✅                ✅ (via buildah)
Named volumes          ✅                ✅
Networks               ✅                ⚠️ (most work)
Secrets                ✅                ✅
Volume plugins         ✅                ❌
BuildKit features      ✅                ⚠️ (partial)
```

The 5% that break are usually Docker-specific volume drivers, proprietary network plugins, and build arguments that assume Docker BuildKit. For most teams, switching is painless.

```bash
# Works for most projects
podman compose up
```

## Performance: Nearly Identical

Both Docker and Podman use the same underlying runtime (runc or crun). The numbers are essentially the same. Podman actually has a slight edge in container startup time because there's no daemon overhead.

## Desktop Experience: Docker Still Leads

Docker Desktop is polished — GUI, extensions, dev environments. Podman Desktop exists and is improving fast, but it's not at feature parity yet. If you rely on Docker Desktop's GUI features, that's a real consideration.

## The Cost Factor

Docker Desktop requires a paid subscription for companies with **more than 250 employees** or **more than $10 million in revenue**. Podman is completely free. For large organizations, this alone is often the deciding factor.

## The Verdict: Which One Should You Use?

**Choose Docker when:**
- Your team relies on Docker Desktop's GUI features or extensions
- Your CI/CD pipeline is deeply integrated with Docker tooling
- You're a small team and the free tier covers you

**Choose Podman when:**
- Security is a priority (rootless containers by default)
- You're deploying to Kubernetes (native pod support + YAML export)
- You're in an enterprise looking to avoid Docker licensing costs
- You're on RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora (Podman is built-in)
- You want systemd integration for container management

In 2026, Podman is no longer the underdog. For Kubernetes-native workflows and security-conscious teams, it's the better choice. For teams deep in the Docker ecosystem with existing tooling, Docker still works fine.

The good news? `alias docker=podman` works for 95% of commands.
